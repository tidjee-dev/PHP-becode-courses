# Setup

## Local Development Server

When we work on a project, we don't work directly on the machine that will serve the files of the website or application, because the slightest typo or mistake would look bad and could hurt the client's brand image (at the very least).

So we develop on our own PC ("**development environment**"), until the files are ready for production (we then put them on the "**production environment**").

### How to setup a local development environment ? (mandatory)

To develop in PHP, you need to install the PHP software.
To interact with a database you need a RDBM (relational database manager) for example: Mysql, MariaDb, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
An to run those (PHP and a RDBM) you need a Web server, apache or nginx are the most commons.

The most common stacks are LAMP and LEMP : Linux + Apache (or nginx, pronounced "Engine X") + MySQL + PHP.

#### You want an easy install ?

If you're using Linux or windows without the WSL. The easiest way to install the lamp stack is to install a software such as XAMPP(only windows and linux) or MAMP( only windows and macos)
For MacOS mamp is the easiest.

#### Using Linux (WSL on windows included) ?


You can chose to install everything separately using the terminal by following one of the following articles ( or search for yourself online, there is dozens of articles )


**DISCLAIMER**: For now you don't have to create a *virtual host*, you may skip that step in the tutorials
Also, we aren't going to use a database right away, so you don't have to configure your RDBM right now, for now you really just need apache and PHP. Come back here later

On windows there is alternatives like xampp, mamp, wamp, laragon.

On macos : if php isn't already installed on your os install it with brew or use mamp.

When you start to play with databases you will get tired of looking at your databases in the terminal here are some GUI to help you with that

-   [PHPMyAdmin](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/phpmyadmin) ( included in xampp and mamp )

# How does the professionals do it ? -> **Docker** ? (OPTIONAL)

**If you are already experienced with php/mysql/apache/mysql you might want to try out Docker.**

Otherwise, come back to docker later, it's a great tool, in the mean time you can directly go to -> [2 : Variables and Conditions](./2-php-variables.md)

[Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/) is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.

### Install Docker & Docker-compose

#### For macOS

Follow the procedure on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

#### For Windows

> ⚠️ Check your Windows 10 version, do you use Pro or Home version ?

##### Pro, Enterprise or Education versions

Follow the procedure on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

##### Home version

To use docker on Windows Home, follow the procedure on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/) or, WSL2.

#### For Linux

1. Follow the procedure on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
1. Run the following command to fix a possible right issue : `sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`
1. Follow the procedure on [the page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
1. Restart your computer

To test your installation, run the command `docker run hello-world`.
